"""MGP message interceptor middleware (MGP §12.7 cancel, §12.9 gap).

The MCP Python SDK's ``BaseSession._receive_loop`` validates every incoming
message against the closed ``ClientRequest`` / ``ClientNotification`` Pydantic
unions before dispatching. Custom MGP Layer-3 methods (e.g.
``mgp/stream/cancel``) and custom notifications (``notifications/mgp.stream.gap``)
are not members of those unions, so they get dropped as ``INVALID_PARAMS``
before any handler sees them.

This module provides :func:`mgp_message_interceptor`, an async task that sits
between the raw stdio read stream and the ``ServerSession``'s read stream. It
pre-dispatches MGP messages (responding directly via the write stream) and
forwards everything else untouched, leaving the MCP SDK none the wiser.

Mount point (see :func:`llm_provider.run_server`)::

    stdio_server()  →  raw_read  ──┐
                                    │ mgp_message_interceptor
    ServerSession  ←──  inner_recv ─┘

Cancel flow (MGP §12.7)
    Kernel sends ``{"method":"mgp/stream/cancel","id":N,"params":{"request_id":M,"reason":"..."}}``
    Interceptor looks up ``_active_streams[M]`` → sets ``cancel_event`` and
    writes a ``JSONRPCResponse`` with ``{cancelled: true, partial_result:
    {content: accumulated_text}}`` to the kernel. Main streaming loop observes
    ``cancel_event`` on the next iteration and terminates cleanly.

Gap flow (MGP §12.9)
    Kernel sends ``notifications/mgp.stream.gap`` with ``missing_indices``.
    Interceptor re-emits matching chunks from ``state.chunk_buffer`` via
    ``write_mgp_stream_chunk``. If any requested index is older than the
    buffer retention window, the interceptor emits
    ``notifications/mgp.stream.gap_unrecoverable`` and skips further
    retransmission for this request.
